It's winter again. We'll have to move to a cheaper apartment soon, so I decided to start packing earlier this time. As I was going through my things, I found this check.

A check from Prof. Knuth, 0x$2.40 in hexadecimal dollars (Par value is 0x$1 = USD2.56). And there is another one of 0x$0.20. I remember receiving them early this year, in February or March. 

Prof. Knuth is a profound computer scientist, famous for TeX, a geeky typesetting program, and *The Art of Computer Programming*, a.k.a. TAOCP. He awards 0x$1.00 to the first finder of any error in his books, and 0x$0.20 for significant suggestions. If you read his books with keen and picky eyes, you might recoup the cost of them, and even make a small fortune. 

Visit [The Bank of San Serriffe](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/boss.html), and you'll find my account listed with a balance of 0x$2.60, along with many others. 

I feel quite upset, though, because I merely spotted trivial typos or places that might be improved; nothing technical. I couldn't understand the topics thoroughly enough to point out mistakes. 

As suggested by my friends and mentors, I'll need to read *Concrete Mathematics* thoroughly and take some algorithm courses before attempting TAOCP again. Hopefully I'll have some time to work on these materials in the spring of next year.
