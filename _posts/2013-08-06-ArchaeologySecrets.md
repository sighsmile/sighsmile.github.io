[This course](https://www.coursera.org/course/secrets) is my favorite by far. Although it is "free" to take courses on Coursera, it costs time; you have to pick a few and give up the others. I take courses that are useful (such as statistics), fun (such as this one), or both (programming and math). I recommend this course, for it offers great fun, and broadens your horizon literally.

Sue is a great teacher. She is friendly, humorous, and inspiring. I had known female scientists and mathematicians before, but I never imagined a female archaeologist. She says she loves her job. She is just so COOL. She won my heart in the first video. By the way, I like her necklaces.     

I was never really interested in archaeology when I was a kid. The reason is apparent: I never watched much TV, so I never knew much about archaeologists at that time; and when I saw Indiana Jones in films later, I was old enough to tell that the figure was more fictional than real. I only got interested after reading some books on really ancient cultures in Americas and other places, and I realized there was logic and science in the field. To be honest, I never dreamed of being an archaeologist myself, but I do think it is great fun.

Being born in a "developing" country, having to go through complicated procedures for each visa, working with low income and few days-off, I have many excuses for not traveling. I have been to many places in China, but outside the mainland, I have only visited Hong Kong. That's why I envy those archaeologists, as well as my classmates in this course, who have been to many parts of the world. I enjoyed the videos on several sites, knowing I may never have the chance to be there, though I might visit Brown University some day; and I was encouraged to visit our national museum, which turned out to be a nice place.   

This is my third course finished on Coursera, and the best experience ever. I did not learn much "skill" in this process, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
