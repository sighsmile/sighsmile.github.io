本文是我对 Simon 雅思 A 类写作课程的总结笔记，主要是宏观策略。
详细示例，请访问 ielts-simon.com。

## 小作文

数据图表报告：

- 第一段 1 句 introduction，复述题目，不要照抄任何短语
- 第二段 2 句 overview，指出图表的两个要点，例如明显的极值、趋势、异同
- 第三段、第四段 details，详细描述对比和变化，给出具体的数字

流程图：

- 第一段 1 句 introduction，复述题目，不要照抄任何短语
- 第二段 2 句 overview，指出流程图的两个要点，例如多少步、起点终点、原料和结果
- 第三段、第四段 details，详细描述每一步

对比设计图：

- 第一段 1 句 introduction，复述题目，不要照抄任何短语
- 第二段 2 句 overview，指出最大的变化，以及完全不变的部分
- 第三段、第四段 details，分区对比两张图的异同
- 或者第三段写重大差异，第四段写其他差异

Tips：

- 不要有自己的评论和总结
- 对于数据图表，要分组对比描述，不要分别单独描述某一年、某一国家、某一类，但是都要提到
- 详略得当，Other 这种类别可以一笔带过，表格中的数字也可以有选择地描述
- 要写正确完整的句子
- 注意时态
- 同义词扩展和替换

### Introduction/Conclusion

Introduction 第一句复述，第二句给出笼统的答案。

Conclusion 以 in conclusion 开头，复述第二句的笼统答案，不要再出现新论点。


四类问题：discussion，opinion，problem and solution，two-part question。

Discussion: Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

- topic: People have different views about X of A as opposed to B. 
- opinion: 
    - While there are some benefits to B, I believe that A is usually more X.
    - While I understand that ..., I believe that there are more benefits than drawbacks.
- conclusion: In conclusion, I would argue that the advantages of A do outweigh the disadvantages.

Opinion: To what extent do you agree or disagree?

- topic: It is sometimes argued that ....
- opinion: 
    - I completely agree that ....
    - In my opinion, it would be wrong to ....
    - While I disagree with the idea of ..., I do believe that ....
- conclusion: 
    - In conclusion, I do not believe that ....

Problem and Solution: Why ..., and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?

- topic: It is true that ....
- opinion: 
    - There are various reasons why ..., but governments could certainly take steps to address this issue.
    - Although there will be some negative consequences, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.

Two-part Question: What factors contribute to ...? How realistic is ...?

    - While a variety of factors may lead to ..., it would be unrealistic to expect ....
    - Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important that modern, international music.
- conclusion: In conclusion, music is a necessary part of human exixtence, and I believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.

### Main Body

最重要！每段 100 词左右。

简单的 linking words 就可以，重点是 topic vocabulary。

两种写法：Firstly/Secondly/Finally，Idea/Explain/Example。

多个 ideas，Firstly/Secondly/Finally

- There are several reasons why I would argue against compulsory community service. 
- Firstly, ....
    - For example, I remember ....
- Secondly, ....
- Finally, ....

一个 idea，Idea/Explain/Example

- On the other hand, the opportunity to do voluntary community service could be extremely positive for students.
- motivated
- gain experience, confidence, skills
- improve career prospects
    - For example, ... might impress a university admissions officer or a future employer.


### 例：Opinion

不要写别人怎么想，要给出自己的意见，明确写出 I believe, in my opinion, etc.

可以写 strong opinion，也可以写 balanced opinion 例如 partly agree。

把钱花在太空探索方面，不如用来建设学校、医院等基础公共设施。To what extent do you agree or disagree?

- topic: money spent on space programmes vs. public services
- opinion: I completely agree -- public services over space projects
- no more space projects, why
    - way too expensive
    - no benefit to normal people, simply politicians showing off
    - high risk of accidents and failures, serious injuries and deaths
        - example: Challenger space shuttle
- better public services, why
    - cheaper
        - example: doctors and teachers are cheaper to train than astronauts
    - wide coverage, connection to every one
        - example: hospitals, schools
    - social benefits, better quality of life, less suffering
- conclusion: spend money on public services
