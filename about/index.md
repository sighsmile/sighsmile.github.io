The blog is based on a template provided by <a href="https://github.com/webfrogs/webfrogs.github.com">webfrogs</a> (as far as I know, he is not the original designer, either). Comments-related features are trimmed off. Some fonts are changed. 

The icon of this site is designed by me. 
*PiCat*, as it is called, is a cat-like, math-oriented creature. It hides its tail *somewhere*, but it definitely has *at least* one.
